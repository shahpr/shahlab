Our new lab website has been directly inspired (in fact, borrowed) from [Trevor Bedford's](http://bedford.io) website. We have used Trevor's GitHub [code](https://github.com/blab/blotter) with minimal modifications. We were also inspired by several stylistic aspects of [Allan Drummond's](http://drummondlab.org/) labpage. 

Detailed instructions on creating this website can be found [here](http://bedford.io/misc/about/).

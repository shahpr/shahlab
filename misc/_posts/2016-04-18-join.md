We are actively recruiting two postdoctoral fellows to join our group. The specific research project is flexible and can be tailored to the interests of the individual, but it will fall under the broad purview of regulation of protein translation and evolution of coding sequences. 

## Computational biology postdoc

Requirements for the position include a PhD in mathematics, statistics, physics, biology or related area. The ideal candidate should also be familiar with scientific programming and be able to handle high-throughput sequencing datasets.

## RNA biology postdoc

Requirements for the position include a PhD in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology or related area. The ideal candidate should have extensive experience in RNA biology, with an interest to work on [ribosome profiling](/papers/paper/weinberg-cellrep-riboprofiling/). 

The postdoctoral fellows will have considerable freedom in developing their own research program, with the resources needed to distinguish themselves. In addition, the fellows will have several opportunities to interact and forge collaborations with research groups both at [Rutgers](http://www.rutgers.edu/) as well as other institutions in the Philadelphia-New York corridor. 

Applications are welcome from candidates of any nationality. Women and under-represented minorities are especially encouraged to apply.

Applicants should email a statement of research interests, CV, and contact details for references to 
premal.shah<span style="display:none">obfuscate</span>@rutgers.edu. Informal inquiries are also welcomed.

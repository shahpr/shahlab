We are super excited (and a bit relieved) to announce that our lab's research will be supported by an NIH R35 grant ([ESI-MIRA](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/mechanisms/MIRA/Pages/default.aspx)) for the next 5 years.
We now have several open positions for both [postdocs](/blog/postdoc-positions/) and graduate students. Informal enquiries welcome!

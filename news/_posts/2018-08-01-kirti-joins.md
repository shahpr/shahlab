[Kirti Gupta](/team/kirti-gupta/) starts as a postdoc in the Shah Lab this Fall. She comes to us after defending a very productive Ph.D. in Molecular and Structural Biology at [CDRI, India](https://cdri.res.in/) in [Dr. Saman Habib](https://cdri.res.in/1485.aspx?id=1485), where identified and characterized ribosomal assembly factors involved in the organellar ribosome biogenesis in _Plasmodium falciparum_. In the Shah Lab Kirti will be developing some cool new methods to study dynamics of translation initiation and co-transcriptional translation. We are really excited to have you. Welcome aboard!

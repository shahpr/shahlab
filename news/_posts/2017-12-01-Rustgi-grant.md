I guess when it rains, it pours! 
We are thrilled that NIDDK R01 submitted by our collaborator [Anil Rustgi](http://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g20000220/p5431) at [UPenn] (https://www.upenn.edu/) will be funded. We will receive a subaward to study the role of post-transcriptional regulation by LIN28B-IMP1 in oncogenic signalling in intestines.

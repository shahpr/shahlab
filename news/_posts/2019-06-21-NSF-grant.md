We are super excited to announce that our lab's research will be supported by an NSF/BBSRC grant awarded to [Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/), [Liana Lareau](http://www.lareaulab.org/), and us. The NSF grant will support [RiboViz](/software/riboviz/) development for more robust pipelines, better visualization, more organisms, and new statistical and analytical tools.

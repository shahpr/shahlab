The lab has doubled in size, again!

Two fantastic genetics majors - [Albert Sultan](/team/al-sultan/) and [Darya Pavlenko](/team/darya-pavlenko/) - have joined the Shah Lab. Albert's research will focus on how genomic GC content influences amino acid usage and therefore protein evolution. Darya's reserach will focus on the role of context-dependence on codon usage in bacteria.

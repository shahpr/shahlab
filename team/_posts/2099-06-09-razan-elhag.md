I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers University currently pursuing opportunities for learning and growth in the field of scientific and clinical research. I am currently learning  me tools to further my skillset in my favorite field of study, genetics. While I study my pre-medical curriculum, my Criminal Justice major shifts my focus towards real-world applications of legality and the field of forensics. This allows me to retain alternate viewpoints on my studies. I hope to utilize my experience with Dr. Shah towards furthering my capabilities both in the research lab and beyond. In my spare time I enjoy reading, watching crime documentaries, and horseback riding.

I’m 22 years old and currently a super senior at Rutgers majoring biology. I grew up in the Jewish community of Deal, NJ with one sibling—my adopted younger brother, Jonathan. I love genetics and computer science and may want to pursue a career in those fields one day. However, in my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball and chess.

I am a first year student in the Molecular Biosciences PhD program. 
I received my undergraduate degree in Biotechnology from Anna University. I then joined as a Junior Research Fellow at Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
During my research training, I worked in the metabolic engineering group headed by Dr. Guhan Jayaraman where my focus was on control of invivo polymerization by synthetic biology approaches. I gained expertise in cloning techniques, chromatographic analysis, operation of bioreactors, etc.

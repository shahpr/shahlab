I am a second year genetics major at Rutgers University. I am from Egg Harbor Township, NJ. I have always had a special interest in cell biology and genetic processes. Some day I hope to attend medical school to ultimately be a part of Doctors Without Borders. Until then, I will be contributing to the work at Shah Lab.

I'm an undergraduate student at the Rutgers University Honors College, majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. Previously, I participated in research on the effects of HDAC3 inhibition on auditory long term memory, as well as on the automation of C. elegans image processing. Beyond lab work, my in-semester time is split between classwork and running for the Rutgers Cross Country team. I love learning about, simulating, and visualizing models of complex systems, as well as working with interesting and thoughtful people.

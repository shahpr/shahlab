I’m a sophomore at Rutgers majoring in Cell Biology & Neuroscience. I was born in Pennsylvania, raised in Wisconsin, and spent my adolescent/teenage years in New Jersey and Hyderabad (India). 

I’m a fan of all things science (including science fiction) and am especially fascinated by cellular biology and genetics.  In the future I hope to one day become a physician and to also complete a marathon in all 7 continents.

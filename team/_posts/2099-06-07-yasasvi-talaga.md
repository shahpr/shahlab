I am a senior at Rutgers University currently majoring in Biology. I was born in India, but grew up in Edison, NJ, and graduated from John P. Stevens High School. I am interested in pursuing either biology or genetics through college and hope to one day pursue medicine. I am also interested in Visual Arts and hope to one day pursue it on the side.

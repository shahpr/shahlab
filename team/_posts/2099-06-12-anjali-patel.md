I am an undergraduate at Rutgers University pursing on the Pre-Med track as a Genetics major. I am originally from Piscataway, New Jersey, but I completed my high school education at Eastern Regional High School in Voorhees, New Jersey. I am really excited to learn more about genome biology and further implement that in my Medical career. Besides working in the lab, I enjoy being Stroll Captain for my sorority (Kappa Phi Gamma Sorority, Inc) and rendering service to my community and university. I believe strongly in helping others and putting smiles on peopleâ€™s faces!

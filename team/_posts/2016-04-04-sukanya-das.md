I am a graduate student in the microbiology and molecular genetics program. I have an engineering degree in Biotechnology from [Manipal Institute of technology](https://manipal.edu/mit.html), Karnataka India. Sparked by an interest in studying infectious diseases I decided to work as a research assistant at [Genext Genomics](http://gng.asia/), an animal biotechnology startup in India, where I worked on characterizing a novel protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis which was found to be essential for its growth. 

Taking a detour from engineering, I decided to get a masters in Biomedical Sciences from [Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, Newark](http://njms.rutgers.edu/gsbs/prospective_students/info/masters_programs.php). At Newark, I worked with Dr [Yuri Bushkin](http://www.phri.org/research/res_pibushkin.asp)  and [Dr Sanjay Tyagi](http://www.phri.org/research/res_pityagi.asp) to study the T cell response to various antigen stimulants using single molecule mRNA FISH and Flow cytometry. I also worked on developing a technique to quantify the mRNA transcripts per cell using data from flow cytometry and smFISH. Studying T cells got me interested in noise in gene expression since it was clear from my experiments that cells with the same phenotype and functions responded with a heterogeneous amount of mRNA molecules per cell leading me into the world of noise and stochastic gene expression. 

Which brings me to the Shah lab, where I aim at studying the underlying mechanisms of noise in gene expression using my [FISH/Flow skills](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.039) and some rudimentary programming skills from undergrad. I also enjoy baking, cooking, working out, gardening and going to the “city” when I am not sciencing.

I am currently a senior at Rutgers majoring in Genetics and Psychology. I am originally from Kiev, Ukraine but have spent most of my life in New Jersey. I graduated from Cherry Hill East High School in 2013. 

In the Shah lab my project will involve looking at the changes in codon frequencies in bacteria and assessing whether or not these changes are context dependent. 

In the future I hope to attend medical school. In addition to working in the Shah Lab, I am also working in a lab with Maker 1 conditional mice. Other than working in a lab I enjoy traveling and taking pictures with my dog.

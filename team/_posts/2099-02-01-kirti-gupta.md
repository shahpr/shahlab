I received my undergraduate degree in Life Sciences from Delhi University, India. I then did my masters in Biosciences from Jamia Millia Islamia where I worked on the characterization of Chikungunya Virus strain from clinical samples in Dr. Shama Parveen’s lab. The aim of the study was to look for novel genetic changes in the isolates by sequence analysis.

I then received my Doctorate degree in Molecular and Structural Biology from CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, India, advised by Dr. Saman Habib. During my PhD, we identified and characterized several ribosomal assembly factors involved in the organellar ribosome biogenesis in Plasmodium falciparum. I gained expertise in cloning, expression and purification of recombinant proteins, IFA, Confocal microscopy.

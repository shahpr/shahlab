I was interested in Genetics since I knew what inheritance was. The idea of having a blueprint of all the possible proteins and expressing them selectively still puts me in awe. This interest led me to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Genetics from [Rutgers University](www.rutgers.edu). After graduation, my interests in genetics did not subside, quite the opposite, and that pushed me to enroll in a masters program at Rutgers. During my masters I joined the Shah lab in 2017 where I studied the changes that occur in the proteome and tRNAs under cellular stress conditions in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers University in the Honors Program. I am interested in learning more about genome biology during my time at Rutgers. I feel that extensive knowledge in genetics can help me in pursuing my ultimate goal of obtaining a medical degree. Aside from working in the lab I like to help my local community with EMT work in addition to spending time with family and friends.

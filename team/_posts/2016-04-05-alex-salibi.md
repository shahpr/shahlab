Hello! I am a first year Masters Student. I graduated with a degree in Molecular Genetics from Rutgers in May 2017. 
I have worked with the CRISPR/CAS system as an undergraduate, but decided to change gears as a graduate student. 
My interest in computational analysis has lead me to join the Shah Lab. I am striving to improve my programing skill and learn something about everything.

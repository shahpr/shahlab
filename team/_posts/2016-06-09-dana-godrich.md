I am a senior at Rutgers majoring in Genetics on a computational route. I am originally from Israel but I have spent most of my life in central New Jersey.

I have big hopes to further my genetics education and research into a graduate school program. I am a big fan of the ethical dilemmas associated with the field and would love to incorporate bioethics with computational genetics.

I enjoy traveling and spent a summer researching snail evolution at the Australian Museum in Sydney, Australia!

Besides this, I am very keen on hiking and trailing, photography, watching an excessive amount of Ted Talks, and laughing at people on Facebook who take The Onion articles very seriously.

I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers University, majoring in Genetics and Computer Science. I graduated from East Brunswick High School in 2016. I hope to one day pursue a career in the computational genetics field. In my spare time, I love to read, and am currently attempting to teach myself Spanish.

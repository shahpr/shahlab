I am a graduate student in the Molecular Biosciences PhD program. I received my undergraduate degree in Biology with a minor in Biochemistry from the University of Delaware where I worked on paracrine signaling between bone stromal cells and metastatic prostate cancer cells in the lab of Dr. Sikes. I then did a masters at Rutgers in Biomedical Sciences where I worked on the role of Sox9 in non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma in the lab of Dr. Pine at CINJ. For two years, I was also a scientist at the Museum of Natural History in New York where I worked on trying to understand the environmental conditions and molecular mechanisms of that led to the endosymbiotic event that created the first photosynthetic Eukaryotes in the lab of Dr. Kim. My first lab rotation was in the lab of Dr. Khare where I worked on computational protein design and antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy.

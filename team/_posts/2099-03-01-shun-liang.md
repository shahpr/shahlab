I received my undergraduate degree in Medicine from [Anhui University of Chinese Medicine][1]. Following graduation, I became a teacher at the Anhui College of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

When I moved to the States, I joined the research team of [Dr. Phil Rea][2] at [University of Pennsylvania][3], where I worked on the membrane transport and detoxification of xenobiotics. Later on, I worked with [Dr. George Coukos][4] on isoform-specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase targeted therapy in ovarian cancer. Then worked with [Dr. Lin Zhang][5] on OncoGenome and EpiGenome in ovarian and breast cancer. More recently, I worked at Childrenâ€™s Hospital at Philadelphia with [Dr. Long X. Zheng][6] on Structure-function analysis of proteinases ADAMTS7 and Autophagy in regulation of von Willebrand factor (VWF) secretion and function.

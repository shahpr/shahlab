I am a sophomore at Rutgers University majoring in Genetics. I am an international student and graduated high school in India. My experience as a student in Metas of Seventhday Adventist High school-2015 has given me a great opportunity to study in the US. I am eager to contribute my enthusiasm and skills. As genetics, major, I am interested in research that focuses on the genetics and molecular biology of microorganisms and human bodies.

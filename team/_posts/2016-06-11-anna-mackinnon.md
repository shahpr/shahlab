I am an undergraduate student in the Rutgers University Honors College currently majoring in genetics and Spanish. I was born and raised in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and graduated from Chapel Hill High School in 2017. I hope to pursue a masters degree in genetic counseling and a career in that field. Besides academics, I am on the Rutgers rowing team and play the guitar.

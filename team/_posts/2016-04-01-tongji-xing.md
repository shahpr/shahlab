I completed my undergraduate studies at [Shanxi University](http://english.sxu.edu.cn/) in Taiyuan, China, during which I spent a year at [Pfeiffer University](http://www.pfeiffer.edu/) in Charlotte, NC. My original interest in plant science led me to pursue a master's degree in plant molecular biology at [Appalachian State University](http://www.appstate.edu/) in Boone, NC. I came to Rutgers in 2014 and explored my interest in data analysis through rotations in several different labs and decided to switch to the field of computational biology. My current research focussed on developing a computational yeast whole cell model to study the effects of noisy transcription on translation

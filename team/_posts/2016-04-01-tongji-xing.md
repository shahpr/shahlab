Tongji Xing completed her undergraduate studies at [Shanxi University](http://english.sxu.edu.cn/) in Taiyuan, China, during which she spent a year at [Pfeiffer University](http://www.pfeiffer.edu/) in Charlotte, NC. Her original interest in plant science led her to pursue a master's degree in plant molecular biology at [Appalachian State University](http://www.appstate.edu/) in Boone, NC. She came to Rutgers in 2014 and explored her interest in data analysis through rotations in several different labs and decided to switch to the field of bioinformatics.

We finally updated our website from the clunky iWeb based one. This was certainly a process. After several false starts and figuring out how html and css work, we made it <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>

This was made possible almost entirely due to efforts of [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io) and the [detailed instructions](http://bedford.io/misc/about/) he provided. Our new lab website has been directly inspired (in fact, borrowed) from [Trevor's](http://bedford.io) website. We have used Trevor's GitHub [code](https://github.com/blab/blotter) with minor modifications. We were also inspired by several stylistic aspects of [Allan Drummond's](http://drummondlab.org/) labpage. 

We have some very interesting works in the pipeline on playing with datasets directly on our website. So stay tuned!

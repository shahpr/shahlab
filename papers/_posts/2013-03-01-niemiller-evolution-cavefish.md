# Abstract 

The genetic mechanisms underlying regressive evolution—the degeneration or loss of a derived trait—are largely unknown, particularly for complex structures such as eyes in cave organisms. In several eyeless animals, the visual photoreceptor <i>rhodopsin</i> appears to have retained functional amino acid sequences. Hypotheses to explain apparent maintenance of function include weak selection for retention of light-sensing abilities and its pleiotropic roles in circadian rhythms and thermotaxis. In contrast, we show that there has been repeated loss of functional constraint of <i>rhodopsin</i> in amblyopsid cavefishes, as at least three cave lineages have independently accumulated unique loss-of-function mutations over the last 10.3 Mya. Although several cave lineages still possess functional <i>rhodopsin</i>, they exhibit increased rates of nonsynonymous mutations that have greater effect on the structure and function of rhodopsin compared to those in surface lineages. These results indicate that functionality of <i>rhodopsin</i> has been repeatedly lost in amblyopsid cavefishes. The presence of a functional copy of <i>rhodopsin</i> in some cave lineages is likely explained by stochastic accumulation of mutations following recent subterranean colonization.
